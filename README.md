## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

My name is **Youssef** and I really like coding & playing, but My main thing is to code and I **LOVE** making advanced projects, here are some of my projects:

## My projects:

### **BatchBot** 
- Is my main and my best projects as it is an AI-Powered discord bot and supports multiple advanced models powered by **Google's Gemini AI Models**, My goal is to make BatchBot the best Open-source and free AI Discord bot! :)

### **Minecraft stress test**
- It is an old project I was working on for fun but I stopped updating this project and got to more advanced stuff like **BatchBot**.

And soon I'm gonna make a lot more projects and advanced ones too!

### Keep in mind
- That I'm just a kid-teenager that likes to code advanced stuff and may not be in the best quality but I'm doing the best I can to make it the best quality I can.

And shout-out to my school **Continental Language School** :D
