## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„

My name is **Youssef** and I'm a passionate coder who **LOVES** creating advanced projects! My main focus is on coding, and I'm always looking for new challenges. Here are some of my projects:

## My projects:

### **BatchBot**

- This is my main project and I'm incredibly proud of it! BatchBot is an AI-Powered Discord bot that utilizes **Google's Gemini AI Models** to offer a variety of advanced features, such as [mention 2-3 core features]. I've built it using [mention language/libraries, e.g., Python and the Discord.py library]. My goal is to make BatchBot the best free and open-source AI Discord bot, and I'm constantly working on new updates and enhancements! [Include GitHub link if available].

### **Minecraft stress test**
- This is an older project I worked on for fun. It was designed to test the performance limits of Minecraft servers by [briefly describe the type of test]. While I've shifted my focus to other projects, it was a valuable experience.

I'm constantly learning and working to improve the quality of my code and projects, and I have some exciting advanced project ideas planned for the future!

I'm just a teenager who loves to code and learn, and I strive to make the best projects I can. I want to give a shout-out to my school, **Continental Language School**!

## ðŸ†• NEW!

I highly recommend checking out my friend's impressive Gemini AI-powered Roblox game, "[Project Gemini](https://www.roblox.com/games/77153392203862/Project-Gemini)", as it showcases some amazing AI interaction.
